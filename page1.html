            <h3> God of War</h3>
            <p> 
                God of War is an action-adventure game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was released for the PlayStation 4 in April 2018, with a Windows port in January 2022. The game is the eighth installment in the God of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's God of War III. Unlike previous games, which were loosely based on Greek mythology, this installment is loosely inspired by Norse mythology, with the majority of it set in ancient Scandinavia in the realm of Midgard. For the first time in the series, there are two protagonists: Kratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only playable character, and his young son, Atreus. Following the death of Kratos' second wife Faye—Atreus' mother—the two embark on a journey to fulfill her request that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the nine realms. Kratos keeps his troubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his divine nature. Along their journey, they come into conflict with monsters and gods of the Norse world.

            <p> IGN rated God of War 10 out of 10 or a masterpiece for its stunning visuals, combat, and storyline.</p>

            <h3> Elden Ring </h3>
            <p> Elden Ring[a] is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. Directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki with worldbuilding provided by fantasy writer George R. R. Martin, it was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on February 25. In the game, players control a customizable player character on a journey to repair the titular Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord.

                Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective, with players freely roaming its interactive open world. The six main areas are traversed using the player character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of transportation, while linear hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Combat is facilitated by several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Checkpoints located throughout the world allow for the player to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called Runes, as well as acting as locations that enable fast travel. Elden Ring features online multiplayer, with players able to join each other for both cooperative and player versus player combat.

            <p> IGN gave Elden Ring a 10 out of 10 for its relentlessly challenging combat and an incredible open world that can entertain anyone for days. </p>
